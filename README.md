# NER Iterate Service

This software is in an early development state. One day it will be a [Dalphi](https://github.com/Dalphi/dalphi) iterate service to do NER based annotations.

## Current task

Do NER using NLTK. If this works, pair it with the current dummy service. Then substitute NLTK's libs with selfmade implementations.
