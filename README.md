# NER Iterate Service

This software is in an early development state. It aims to be a [Dalphi](https://github.com/Dalphi/dalphi) iterate service to do NER based annotations.

This repo contains all the tools you need (currently it's based on some NLTK libs to do the ML - so this is a dependency):

- Dalphi iterate and merge services (HTTP)  
  `python3 iterate_service.py -v -l`
- text shaper to convert a plain text file to a JSON based exchange format (described [here](https://github.com/Dalphi/interface-ner_complete#expected-payload))
  `python3 text_shaper.py input.txt output.json`
- some Python libs for converting the text exchange format to NLTK's tree format and vice versa, handling HTTP communication and a NER pipeline (to easily exchange NLTK's MaxEnt-classifier)

## Prerequisites installation

You may need download some nltk specific resources by running

```
python3
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()
```

and following the installation instructions.

It could be necessary to provide a binary for [MegaM](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/megam/).
Simply download or build it and provide its location by an environment variable, e.g. like

```
export MEGAM=~/.local/bin/megam
```

## Usage

### Prepare

Convert your plain text to Dalphi *raw data*

`python3 text_shaper.py input.txt output.json`

### Launch

`python3 iterate_service.py -v -l`

### Dalphi

- Add the two services (Iterate & Merge) in Dalphi's service overview. Check stdout for details on your address. It will probably be something like  
`http://localhost:5001/iterate` for the Iterate service and  
`http://localhost:5001/merge` for the merge service.
- Assign those services in your project's settings.
- Import all the raw data you generated using the text shaper.
- Run an iteration by selecting the annotation document's tab and click the button within the blank slate.
- Annotate! We recommend the *NER_complete* interface for annotation. It's fully compatible to this service and lives free and open [here](https://github.com/Dalphi/interface-ner_complete).
